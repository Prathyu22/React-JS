React ---> (Open Source) implements the virtual DOM. ---> Creates the copy of DOM.

Virual DOM is the representation/state of the actual DOM.

Instead of modifiying the DOM, React makes the new version of DOM and it calculates the change.
Everytime we make a change, React updates the change and makes the new version of it by storing previous data too.

Faster Method :
--> Modifying the virtual DOM or updating the DOM directly ???
*** Calc./Finding the change between two states is easy that is done by React. ***

**** Virtual DOM is not fast in updating but fast in calc. the difference between 2 states that means the change b/w states. ***

#### Immutable ####
----> Virtual DOM is immutable. 
----> It cannot be updated and hence it creates another version of it.

We need different set of APIs to modify the virtual DOM.
                --------> These APIs are provided by the React.

******* (Reason of two links in index.html)
The React DOM is the actual link b/w DOM and virtual DOM.
The APIs to update the actual DOM (DOM) from virtual DOM are provided via REACT DOM Lib.
React has the APIs that have methods to modify the virtual DOM.

React Js ---> For Browsers. (In thsi we are using React JS)
React Native ---> App Developers.
