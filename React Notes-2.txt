useEffect() ---> It has 2 parameters
            ---> 1. Functions that are going to run
                 2. Dependencies.
            --->Hook, that allows hook into the function.
            ---> If we give empty array, we can see only one mount.

setContent() ---> Everytime we come across this, we rerender the element.
